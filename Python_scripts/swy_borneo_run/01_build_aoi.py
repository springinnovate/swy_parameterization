"""Build the Borneo AOI polygon from HydroBASINS.

Reconstruction note: `data/swy/borneo/inputs/borneo_aoi.gpkg` was originally built
interactively (2026-09-10) and the exact bbox parameters used weren't captured in a script at
the time. This script is a faithful reconstruction using Borneo's standard geographic extent,
not a guaranteed byte-identical replay — if regenerating, verify the computed area against the
figure already validated (753,803 km^2 vs. Borneo's real ~743,330 km^2, 1.4% off) rather than
assuming this reproduces the exact original polygon vertex-for-vertex.

Uses HydroBASINS Australia/Oceania (not "Asia" — that region's bbox cuts off at ~1 degree N and
does not reach Borneo's latitude), level-6 Pfafstetter units, dissolved into one polygon and
clipped to Borneo's bbox to avoid leaking into Sulawesi/Sumatra/Java (which are geographically
close and can share basin-unit boundaries at this level).
